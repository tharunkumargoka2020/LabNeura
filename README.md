# LabNeura

LabNeura is a comprehensive library designed for implementing basic to advanced algorithms in C++, with a focus on efficiency. The library is exposed as a module using Pybind11, allowing users to call its functionality from both Python and C++. LabNeura covers a wide range of algorithms, from basic sorting and graph algorithms to machine learning, reinforcement learning, and deep learning algorithms.

## Usage

### Using LabNeura in Python

Here's an example of how to use LabNeura's sorting algorithms in Python:

```python
import labneura

# Create an instance of the Sorting class
sorting = labneura.Sorting([3, 6, 8, 10, 1, 2, 1])

# Perform bubble sort
sorting.bubble()
print("Bubble sorted array:", sorting.data)

# Perform quick sort
sorting.quick()
print("Quick sorted array:", sorting.data)
```

### Using LabNeura in C++

Include the LabNeura headers in your C++ project:

```cpp
#include <labneura/sorting.hpp>

int main() {
    std::vector<int> data = {3, 6, 8, 10, 1, 2, 1};
    Sorting sorting(data);

    // Perform bubble sort
    sorting.bubble();
    std::cout << "Bubble sorted array: ";
    for (const auto& num : sorting.getData()) {
        std::cout << num << " ";
    }
    std::cout << std::endl;

    // Perform quick sort
    sorting.quick();
    std::cout << "Quick sorted array: ";
    for (const auto& num : sorting.getData()) {
        std::cout << num << " ";
    }
    std::cout << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```
